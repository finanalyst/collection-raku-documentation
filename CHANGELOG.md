# 2021-01-22 Spin off Collection into its own Module
*  the intention was always for Raku-Alt-Documentation to be the first collection, but not the last.

*  This module now has a small initialisation file and binary to start it

*  The focus in this module will be on plugins, templates, and Website source files

# 2021-01-25 Change name to reflect Collection hierarchy


*  Renamed various files/entities to reflect new names

*  Shortened README, removing most option/plugin/stage information to Collection docs.
