=TITLE Image plugin for Collection

This is a render milestone plugin that moves images in the assets directory (as given in the B<Collection> level configuration)
to the C<assets/images/> directory. More detail can be found in the Collection README regarding assets.

=head1 Blocks

The block name is C<Image>, though <image> is also possible.

    =for Image :src<path-to-image-in-collection-assets-directory> :id<optional-id-given-to-img>  :alt<optional> :class<extra>
    This text will be included in the Table of Contents by default, but not visible with the image

=item C<src> must be an image inside the Collection's asset directory
=item C<id> is an option id attached to the <img> tag, and can be used for styling
=item C<alt> is given the the alt attribute of the <img> tag
=item C<class> is included in the class list of the outer C<div> container

head1 Template

The default template renders the image as

    <div class="image-container other classes"><img src="path-to-source" alt="alt text" id="id"></img>

=head1 Styling

The plugin provides three classes by default: C<justify-right>, C<justify-center> and C<justify-left>, moving the image accordingly.
